# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was The Gaming Room who currently had a game called 'Draw It or Lose It' operating on an Android platform. The client wanted to create a web-based game to where it could be operated on multiple platforms, while keeping the game design the same. 

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I do not think I did anything particularly well in developing this documentation. This was a learning curve for me and there are still many aspects I could improve on. However, I feel that I did well in taking the constructive feedback and utilizing it to better my software design document. It helped me have a better understanding, revise it, and in return produce a document that was more efficient. 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through a design document really helps to develop the code. By analyzing the domain model and UML diagram, it gives a better understanding of the concepts and structure of the classes to implement when developing the code.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose the 'recommendations' section of the document to revise. I would improve it by doing more research to give an in-depth explanation of the recommended software to use. I think my explanation I provided gave a brief overview but it could be better. If someone with no experience or knowledge of software platforms, storage, and memory were to read the document, I would want my explanations to be understandable and provide that insight.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It is very important to consider the user's needs because in the end, it is the user who will be using it. So it is important to make sure the software design is not only catered to the client but also catered to the user.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
When designing software, start off with the requirements and make sure it is approved by the client. Many projects use the agile method, therefore I would use the change management process. This will help the team to maintain organizational structure and manage risk if there are any new or revised requirements.
